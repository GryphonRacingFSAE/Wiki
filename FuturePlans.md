# Future Plans for Low Voltage/Embedded

- `Embedded-Dash`
    - Transition from an RPi 1/4 platform to RPi Zero or similar SBC
    - Transition from [PiCAN](https://copperhilltech.com/pican-2-can-bus-interface-for-raspberry-pi/) to a custom PCB
    - Include Power supply on custom PCB
- `VCU`
    - Add accelerometer & GPS
    - Move to custom STM32 based board instead of Nucleo
    - Move to Github
        - Diffs on PCBs
- `SMB`
    - Reduce components on board?
    - Move to Github
        - Diffs on PCBs
- `BSPD`
    - Move to github
    - Add indicator lights for all statuses
    - Reduce footprint by 75%
    - Remove trimming pots for detection of short or open circuit
    - Move to Github
        - Diffs on PCBs
- `Tractive Board`
    - Move to Github
        - Diffs on PCBs
- `Shutdown/Power Distribution Board`
    - Indicator LEDs
    - Move to Github
        - Diffs on PCBs
- `Custom ST-Link`
    - Use stm32 or smth
- `Gryphon Racing Website`
    - We should move this to a custom website, and update and make it prettier
- `Shop Monitor`
    - Discord bot for shop-open messages
    - Cameras in shop (Prevent misuse)
- `Shop Server`
    - Some sort of self-hosted server to run items on
    - Discord Bots can only be hosted on one server unless sharding is used, which is only available on 2000+ server bots (obviously not applicable)
        - Thus we should self-host the bot, and use an HTTP server to communicate with it from multiple sources
    - Artifactory CE for Conan for the Dash (only use currently)
