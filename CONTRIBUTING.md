## Formatting Code on Discord

Use ``` (triple backticks) to start a code block, add your language identifier afterward to get code coloring, finish the message with another triple backticks to finish.
````
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello world!");
}
```
````
displays as:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello world!");
}
```
